**ROOMRAIDERS**

RoomRaiders helps students find empty classrooms to study in. Libraries are often over-congested and there’s limited room. Sometimes, it's also inconvenient to just go home to study especially for commuters. So, maybe it’s time to try studying in classrooms because who even uses them. RoomRaiders gotchu. RoomRaiders will help expedite the process for students looking for study spots by helping them find empty classrooms around campus. 

RoomRaiders works by scraping course information off Workday for classroom availability. The database stores the times for classrooms and when they're in use. Users are able to select the time and the building they want to study in, and RoomRaiders displays the number of rooms and which specific ones are available.
